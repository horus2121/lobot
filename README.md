## Stacks Used

- [tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri)
- [svelte-kit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit)
- [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with the Tauri project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

1. Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org.

2. Rust: Tauri is powered by Rust, so you'll need to have Rust installed. You can install Rust by following the instructions on their website: https://www.rust-lang.org.

<!-- 3. LLM: Place a GGML-targeting `.bin` LLM model (currently only tested with Llama model) in the `llm` folder. -->

Once you have these prerequisites installed, you're ready to start working with Tauri and building your applications.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager, e.g. `npm install` or `yarn install`.

## Development

To start the development server, run `npm run tauri dev`, or `cargo tauri dev` if you have Tauri CLI installed. This will launch the Tauri application and open a development window. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically reload the application.

## Download

Not yet.
